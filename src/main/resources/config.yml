# A populator is responsible for generating a small area of blocks, for example, ores in the ground.
#
# Vanilla values for ore generation can be found on the wiki: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mineral_vein.
# Most of the time, the values found there will produce the same results if plugged in here. But some might differ
# slightly (e.g. "tries" for emerald).
#
# POPULATOR FORMAT:
# - material: <block>                           # the material of the blocks to generate, or "all" for all blocks (only for replacing)
#   type: [VEIN|SINGLE] (VEIN)                  # the populator type: VEIN for clusters, SINGLE for solo blocks
#   size: <vein size> (1)                       # the size of the veins to generate (not exact for veins)
#   tries: <generation tries per chunk> (0.0)   # number of generation attempts per chunk
#   min-height: <min generation height> (0)     # the min height to generate at
#   max-height: <max generation height> (255)   # the max height to generate at
#   replace-with: <block> (none)                # type of block to replace previous instances of the specified material with, or "none" for not removing
#   replace-rest-with: <block> (none)           # type of block to replace all other blocks with, or "none" for not removing
#   can-replace:                                # the type of blocks that can be replaced in the generation, or "all" for all
#     - stone
#     - andesite
#     - diorite
#     - granite
#     - polished_andesite
